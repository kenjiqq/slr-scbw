\textbf{Towards conscious-like behavior in computer game characters}\\
\textit{Authors:} Arrabales, Ra\'{u}l; Ledezma, Agapito; Sanchis, Araceli\\
\textit{Reviewed by:} Dag {\O}yvind\\
\textit{Quality score:} 6,67\\
\textit{Review:} The article describes the architecture Cera-Cranium, a cognitive architecture.  We see influences from many other forms of architectures, but this adds a twist in the form of ``focus of attention''.  This allows the architecture to reason along several parallel threads, and then select objectives to focus on.  In the article, the main focus is on achieving conscious-like behavior (as per the title) in FPS-bots.  The architecture was however developed for applications in robotics, with a strong focus on adaptability to other domains.  Due to this, we believe it may be applicable to our RTS-domain.

\textbf{An Architecture for Autonomy}\\
\textit{Authors:}: Alami, R; Chatila, R; Fleury, S; Ghallab, S; Ingrand, F\\
\textit{Reviewed by:} Dag {\O}yvind\\
\textit{Quality score:} 6,90\\
\textit{Review:} The article provides a detailed description of a three-layer architecture for robot control.  First, we are given a global view of the architecture, the layers, along with their responsibilities and a rationale for their inclusion in the architecture.  The authors then continue with explanations of each layer, how to implement them, issues which may arise and finally their own implementation in a sample domain.  The last third of the article then gives further details in the form of a complete example using mail delivery robots.  While the article mainly focuses on robot control, the architecture should easily be transferrable to our domain, and has facilities for both reactive control and higher level constructs such as learning.

\textbf{Non-communicative multi-robot coordination in dynamic environments}\\
\textit{Authors:}: Kok, J; Spaan, M; Vlassis, N\\
\textit{Reviewed by:} {\O}ystein\\
\textit{Quality score:} 7,50\\
\textit{Review:} The paper is about coordination of several autonomous agents (robots) playing RoboSoccer, by means of coordination graphs (CGs), ie. local constraints between subsets of the agents. The agents can only rely on their own noisy perception to sense the world state and cooperate, which is quite different from an RTS setting. There is also focus on coordination without communication, ie. predicting what actions the other agents will most likely take. There is some talk of game theory.  If implementing the RTS bot as a MAS, there might be something of interest here.

\textbf{Modeling interaction strategies using POS: An application to soccer robots}\\
\textit{Authors:}: Koning, Jean-Luc; Oudeyer, Pierre-Yves\\
\textit{Reviewed by:} {\O}ystein\\
\textit{Quality score:} 6,79\\
\textit{Review:} Not really about agent architecture, but about how to separate the communication protocol from agent architecture in a cooperative multi-agent system, ie. the agents need to have communication ability, which can be applied to any custom protocol. The example domain is RoboSoccer. There are basically a set of robots playing soccer, each of which is an autonomous agent, and the agents communicate with each other. If implementing the RTS bot as a MAS, there might be something of interest here.

\textbf{Transfer Learning of Hierarchical Task-Network Planning Methods in a Real-Time Strategy Game}\\
\textit{Authors:}: Lee-Urban, Stephen; Mu\~{n}oz-avila, H\'{e}ctor; Parker, Austin; Kuter, Ugur; Nau, Dana\\
\textit{Reviewed by:} {\O}ystein\\
\textit{Quality score:} 9,64\\
\textit{Review:} This paper concerns management of the hierarchy of tasks and subtasks in a game. The game domain used is an RTS called ``MadRTS''. The main focus is on integrating planning and learning of HTN methods, ie. when different methods are applicable. An architecture for this is presented. Interesting article with potentially high relevance for our domain.

\textbf{An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior}\\
\textit{Authors:}: Lent, Michael van; Fisher, William; Mancuso, Michael\\
\textit{Reviewed by:} {\O}ystein\\
\textit{Quality score:} 6,43\\
\textit{Review:} Describes the AI system of a military training software named ``Full Spectrum Command'', which is something like a first person RTS. It focuses only on the tactical aspect, ie. no resource gathering or unit building, but it does describe a potentially useful architecture for modularizing the AI, although the description is rather superficial. The main focus is on the software's ability to explain the reasoning of the AI to the user.

\textbf{Program Steering : Improving Adaptability and Mode Selection via Dynamic Analysis}\\
\textit{Authors:}: Lin, Lee Chuan\\
\textit{Reviewed by:} {\O}ystein\\
\textit{Quality score:} 7,50\\
\textit{Review:} MSc dissertation concerning the use of a kind of machine learning technique to improve program steering. Program steering means that the agent can be in one of a number of different modes, and we are concerned with steering it into the most appropriate mode in a given situation. The conditions for beeing in a mode are preprogrammed by the developer. A machine learning technique is used for selecting mode in situations that were not thought of by the developer. Training cases are chosen from test runs where the agent acts correctly. Later the agent uses these data to select the most appropriate mode in any situation, even though the particular situation may not have been thought of in the original program. It is applied to a couple of domains, including a sort of RTS which consists of several completely autonomous agents that need to sense and act (noisily) on their own and try to cooperate, ie. there is no omniscient ``overmind''.

\textbf{Intelligent online case-based planning agent model for real-time strategy games}\\
\textit{Authors:} Fathy, Ibrahim, Aref Mostafa, Enayet Omar, Al-Ogail Abdelrahman	\\

\textit{Reviewed by:} Robin\\
\textit{Quality score:} 7.62\\
\textit{Review:} This paper argues that an interface between real-time systems, exemplified by the game Unreal Tournament 2004 and Belief-Desire-Intention agents would be a useful tool and goes on to describe such an interface.

It rounds off by discussing the results of training students to write agents with the system.
